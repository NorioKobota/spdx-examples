# SPDX Usage Examples

This repository includes demonstrations of [SPDX](https://spdx.dev) for various
scenarios and use cases.

The repository is organized by profiles which represents a set of scenarios and
use cases for a particular domain (e.g. security, license compliance).
Each directory contains a README.md file describing the profile and the
examples contained within that directory.

The presentations directory contains examples included in various SPDX
presentations.

Please note that this repository does not contain all of the supported fields
nor all of the supported serialization formats in the latest version of the
spec.

- Please see the `examples/` directory in
  [spdx-spec](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/) repo for the examples that
  contain all of the supported fields and formats for a specific spec version.
  This is organized using repo branch. For example, SPDX 3.0 examples will be
  in [v3.0](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/tree/development/v3.0/examples)
  branch and SPDX 2.3 examples will be in
  [v2.3](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/tree/development/v2.3/examples)
  branch.
- Moreover, in a page for each field in
  [SPDX Specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/), there can also
  be a code snippet demonstrating how to use that particular field.
